# Privacy Mode

Privacy mode is an Obsidian plugin that prevents the editor from being read while out in public. It replaces document text with a dot-only font. Selected text gets revealed for easier editing/reading.

## Features

- Replaces document text with a dot-only font.
- Reveals selected text for easier editing/reading.
- Can be enabled/disabled using the command palette.
- Applies to editing mode only.
- Entirely private. No data is sent to any servers ever.

## Enabling / Disabling privacy mode

Privacy mode can be enabled/disabled using the following commands in the command palette:

## Installing
I've submitted the plugin to the Obsidian community, but it's not yet approved.  In the meantime, you can install it manually by following these steps:

1. Download the latest main.js, manifest.json, and styles.css from the [releases page](https://github.com/tiniscule/obsidian-privacy-mode/releases)
2. Copy the files to your Obsidian vault's `Vault/.obsidian/plugins/privacy-mode` folder
3. Restart Obsidian
4. Enable the plugin in the Obsidian settings
