# Contributing
Any and all pull-requests or issues are welcome.  I'll review as soon as I can.

# Creating a release
This can only be done by a repo owner, just documenting here for future me.

Update the version in the tag to match the version in the manifest.json.

```bash
npm version patch
git push origin 1.0.1
```
